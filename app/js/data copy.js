    "Schedule the service": " A number of consumers can be expected to hold off on new vehicle purchases in the immediate future. These purchase delays will benefit the auto maintenance industry as consumers will prioritize repairs on their current vehicle. While the COVID-19 pandemic is vastly different from the 2008 Recession, there are a few exceptions where consumer behaviors will parallel, one of which being vehicle maintenance. During times of economic distress, consumers are more likely to invest in repairing their current vehicle rather than invest in a newer model. While the pandemic will be a boon to the auto maintenance industry, OEMs still have an opportunity to capitalize on the current environment. OEMs have been heavily prioritizing new vehicle incentives since the start of the pandemic. And while it’s great to see such record breaking incentives being offered – it ignores the consumers who can’t afford a new vehicle and are scrambling to figure out how to afford necessary repairs to their current vehicle.\r\n- Mintel: Car Purchasing Process: Incl Impact Of COVID-19 US, July 2020.",
    "Re evaluate choices": "More than 50% of consumers said they\r\nwould prefer to purchase a vehicle from the same auto brand. While loyalty has strong emotional sentiments, this sentiment from consumers most likely comes from a mindset of convenience rather than a strong desire to form an emotional connection to an automaker.\r\n\r\nBy having a desire to purchase from the same auto brand, consumers likely are looking for a way to simplify the car purchasing process and reduce the amount of research necessary. They would have a baseline understanding of what to expect from a familiar automaker rather than having to spend lots of time researching vehicle types, specifications and incentive offerings\r\n\r\n55% of customers say they'd prefer to purchase a car from the same auto brand.\r\n\r\n75% of customers say that 'low maintenance earns my loyalty to autp brands'",
